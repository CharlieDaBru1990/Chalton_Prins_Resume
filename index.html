            <p>
                Having worked in the Tech industry for the past going on 6 years, I have grown a real passion for technology.
                Although I have worked on the Business Development spectrum, I have been exposed to the programming side of the software
                technologies I was working with. After an intial dive in and getting my hands dirty with a few basics I was instantly hooked
                with programming and needless to say the bug bit hard. 
                <br>

                I am now fully vested in my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer focusing on MERN stack development.

                This little project is one of my first demontrations of working with the Web storage API and JSON to
                store
                user input and transfer it from one webpage to another. It asks the user to enter some information about
                their city of choice and then displays the weather information on the page.
